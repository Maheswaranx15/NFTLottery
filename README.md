# NFTLottery
An NFT lottery is a type of lottery game where players purchase tickets using cryptocurrency, and the winners are chosen randomly from the pool of ticket holders. Unlike traditional lotteries, where the prize pool is funded by ticket sales, NFT lotteries use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as the prize.
